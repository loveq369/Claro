h2. Why?

C'mon, do you really like writing reams of C++ code or a billion CSS tags
just to get that button to be in *just* the right position?  Neither do we.
That's why Claro Graphics has LEL.  We also feel that there's really no decent 
C GUI library that is simple and uses native widgets.  All the other C
libraries are either kitchen sinks or are dead (or are dead ugly).

For us, Claro is a tool we're writing so we can write other applications
more easily.  Some of us write networking programs, others just like to 
have fun.  Either way, Claro is intended to make the coding of applications
easier.
