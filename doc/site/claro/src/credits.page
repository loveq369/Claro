<legend>Theo Julienne</legend>
Claro was originally started by "Theo":http://theo.julienne.org after he got sick of using the available
toolkits (especially Qt) for the open-source rewrite of the 
"Bersirc":http://bersirc.free2code.net/index.php/home IRC client.

<legend>Zed A. Shaw</legend>
"Zed":http://www.zedshaw.com/ joined the Claro project out of pure boredom with everything else on the
Internet and at the urging of an extreme dose of Nirvana (the band).  After
playing with Bersirc and seeing how the original Claro was designed, he decided to throw 
in whatever he could to make it better.  His own evil genius is present in the LEL layout
code and the majority of this site.  So yes, I wrote this.

<legend>Dave Collien</legend>
Dave designed the logo and is not responsible for any of the coding, in fact he has never seen the code, 
yet he is responsible for maintaining good morale and regularly saying "I <3 Claro".
