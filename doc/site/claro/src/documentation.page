You can check out the "API":api/html/index.html docs for the current
library documentation.  We'll be adding tutorials shortly.

Check out the "introduction":intro.html for a small example of building
a Claro application from scratch.  It doesn't cover how to actually do
the build, but we're not done simplifying that.
