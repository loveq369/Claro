h2. Mailing Lists

There's currently a mailing list for people interested in Claro development 
"that you can subscribe to online.":http://mail.lists.libclaro.org/mailman/listinfo/graphics-dev_lists.libclaro.org

You can also join the #claro IRC channel at irc.free2code.net.  The developers hang out there
and answer people's questions.

As a backup plan we also hang out on #claro at irc.freenode.net since some people 
like that one too.
